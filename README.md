# Signal Ghost

A dying radio signal bouncing across a dark city at night. Navigate your signal pulse through relay antennas to reach the receiver before your energy fades.

## Gameplay

Tap relay towers to redirect your signal pulse. Each bounce costs energy - choose your path wisely! Avoid red interference zones that drain extra energy. Reach the receiver tower to complete each level.

- **Level 1**: 3 hops - Small grid
- **Level 2**: 5 hops - Introducing interference
- **Level 3**: 7 hops - More complex routing
- **Level 4**: 9 hops - Larger city, more towers
- **Level 5**: 12 hops - The final challenge

## Controls

- **Tap/Click** on a relay tower to redirect your signal pulse
